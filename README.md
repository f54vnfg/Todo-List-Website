# Todo-List-Website

This is a really cool project I built after completing the **TeamTreeHouse** front-end development track. The idea for this small web projected was inspired by the <a href="https://todoist.com">todoist.com</a> website.

The website is built using **HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript**. JavaScript is heavily utilized for a lot of different functions to manipulate each task.

I am very proud of this project, as this was my first proper custom web project where I accomplish things I didn't believe were possible for me, like the many JavaScript functions which manipulated each task and showed on the page while saving it behind the scene or the search function.

Behind the scene a lot of cool stuff can happen like: moving tasks up, down, deleting, adding tasks and even making simple search queries and matching words. There is quite a bit more in the code. If you are interested, take a look in the source code, it's really interesting.
